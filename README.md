This project aims to provide a simple yet effective calorie tracking application, featuring user login and </br>
registration to enable secure access to personal data and exploration of the app's functionalities. Key </br>
features include the ability to input and delete food calorie entries, with detailed categorization of calories </br>
by meal type, including fat, carbs, and protein. Users can also manage their profiles by inputting and </br>
updating their information. </br>
The app offers both daily and weekly views of calorie consumption and displays a weekly bar chart for </br>
visual analysis of calorie intake. Integration with Apache Derby databases ensures robust data storage, </br>
while various APIs are utilized to enhance data sources and functionality. This system provides users with </br>
a comprehensive tool to manage their dietary intake, supporting healthier lifestyle choices through </br>
detailed tracking and clear visualizations.</br>
